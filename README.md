# Kitty Connection

Kitty Connection is a web application that can be used to store information about adoptable cats, as well as apply to adopt those cats. Cats must be assigned a shelter on creation, and each user may only to apply each cat once. Cats and applications can only be created by registered users.

This repository contains both the frontend and backend code required to get the application running.

This app will be improved upon to give it more functionality, and ideally, eventually it will have enough functionality to be used by shelters in my local area.
